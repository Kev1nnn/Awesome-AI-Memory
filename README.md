## 👋 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved into powerful general-purpose reasoning and generation engines. Nevertheless, despite their continuously advancing capabilities, LLMs remain fundamentally constrained by a critical limitation: the finite length of their context window. This constraint defines the scope of information directly accessible during a single inference process, endowing models with only short-term memory capabilities. Consequently, they struggle to support extended conversations, personalized interactions, continuous learning, and complex multi-stage tasks.

To transcend the inherent limitations of context windows, AI memory and memory systems for LLMs have emerged as a vital and active research and engineering frontier. By introducing external, persistent, and controllable memory structures beyond model parameters, these systems enable large models to store, retrieve, compress, and manage historical information during generation processes. This capability allows models to continuously leverage long-term experiences within limited context windows, achieving cross-session consistency and continuous reasoning abilities.

Awesome-AI-Memory is a comprehensive repository dedicated to AI memory and memory systems for large language models, systematically curating relevant research papers, framework tools, and practical implementations. This repository endeavors to map the rapidly evolving research landscape in LLM memory systems, bridging multiple disciplines including natural language processing, information retrieval, intelligent agent systems, and cognitive science.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- LLM Memory: A fusion of implicit knowledge encoded within parameters (acquired during training) and explicit storage outside parameters (retrieved at runtime), enabling models to transcend token limitations and possess human-like abilities to "remember the past, understand the present, and predict the future."

- Memory System: The complete technical stack implementing memory functionality for large language models, comprising four core components:
  - Memory Storage Layer: Vector databases (e.g., Chroma, Weaviate), graph databases, or hybrid storage solutions
  - Memory Processing Layer: Embedding models, summarization generators, and memory segmenters
  - Memory Retrieval Layer: Multi-stage retrievers, reranking modules, and context injectors
  - Memory Control Layer: Memory prioritization managers, forgetting controllers, and consistency coordinators

- Memory Operations: Atomic memory operations executed through tool calling in memory systems:
  - Writing: Converting dialogue content into vectors for storage, often combined with summarization to reduce noise
  - Retrieval: Generating queries based on current context to obtain Top-K relevant memories
  - Updating: Finding relevant memories via vector similarity and replacing or enhancing them
  - Deletion: Removing specific memories based on user instructions or automatic policies (e.g., privacy expiration)
  - Compression: Merging multiple related memories into summaries to free storage space

- Memory Management: The methodology for managing memories within memory systems, including:
  - Memory Lifecycle: End-to-end management from creation, active usage, infrequent access, to archiving/deletion
  - Conflict Resolution: Arbitration mechanisms for contradictory information (e.g., timestamp priority, source credibility weighting)
  - Resource Budgeting: Allocating memory quotas to different users/tasks to prevent resource abuse
  - Security Governance: Automatic detection and de-identification of PII (Personally Identifiable Information)

- Memory Classification: A multi-dimensional classification system unique to memory systems:
  - By Access Frequency: Working memory (current tasks), frequent memory (personal preferences), archived memory (historical records)
  - By Structured Degree: Structured memory (database records), semi-structured memory (dialogue summaries), unstructured memory (raw conversations)
  - By Sharing Scope: Personal memory (single user), team memory (collaborative spaces), public memory (shared knowledge bases)
  - By Temporal Validity: Permanent memory (core facts), temporary memory (conversation context), time-sensitive memory (e.g., "user is in a bad mood today")

- Memory Mechanisms: Core technical components enabling memory system functionality:
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhancing generation by retrieving relevant information from knowledge bases
  - Memory Reflection Loop: Models periodically "review" conversation history to generate high-level summaries
  - Memory Routing: Automatically selecting retrieval sources based on query type (personal memory/public knowledge base)

- Explicit Memory: Memory stored as raw text outside the model, implemented through vector databases with hybrid indexing strategies:
  - Dense Vector Indexing: Handling semantic similarity queries
  - Sparse Keyword Indexing: Processing exact match queries
  - Multi-vector Indexing: Segmenting long documents into multiple parts, each independently indexed

- Parametric Memory: Knowledge and capabilities stored within the fixed weights of a language model's architecture, characterized by:
  - Serving as the model's core long-term semantic memory carrier
  - Being activatable without external retrieval or explicit contextual support
  - Providing the foundational capability for zero-shot reasoning, general responses, and language generation

- Long-Term Memory: Key information designed for persistent storage, typically implemented as external knowledge bases with capabilities including:
  - Automatic Summarization: Distilling multi-turn dialogues into structured memory
  - Context Binding: Recording memory context to prevent erroneous generalization
  - Multimodal Storage: Simultaneously preserving text, images, audio, and other multimodal memories

- Short-Term Memory: Active information within the LLM's context window, constrained by attention mechanisms. Key techniques include:
  - KV Cache Management: Reusing key-value caches to reduce redundant computation
  - Context Compression: Using summaries instead of detailed history (e.g., "the previous 5 dialogue rounds discussed project budget")
  - Sliding Window Attention: Focusing only on the most recent N tokens while preserving special markers
  - Memory Summary Injection: Dynamically inserting summaries of long-term memory into short-term context

- Episodic Memory: Memory type recording specific user interaction history, fundamental to personalized AI:
  - User Identity Recognition: Identifying the same user across sessions
  - Interaction Trajectory Recording: Preserving user decision paths and feedback
  - Emotional State Tracking: Recording patterns of user mood changes
  - Preference Evolution Modeling: Capturing long-term changes in user interests

- Memory Forgetting: Deliberately designed forgetting mechanisms in large models, including:
  - Selective Forgetting (Machine Unlearning): Removing the influence of specific information from training data, such as covering specific knowledge with forgetting layers
  - Privacy-Driven Forgetting: Automatically identifying and deleting PII information, or setting automatic expiration
  - Memory Decay: Automatically lowering the priority of infrequently accessed memories based on usage frequency
  - Conflict-Driven Forgetting: Strategically updating or discarding old memories when new evidence conflicts with them

- Memory Retrieval: The complex process of precisely locating relevant information from massive memory repositories:
  - Semantic Pre-filtering: Vector similarity matching to obtain Top-100 candidates
  - Contextual Reranking: Reordering results based on current query context
  - Temporal Filtering: Prioritizing the most recent relevant information

- Memory Compression: A collection of techniques maximizing memory utility under limited resources:
  - Content-level Compression: Extracting core information while discarding redundant details
  - Representation-level Compression: Vector quantization (e.g., PQ coding), dimensionality reduction
  - Organization-level Compression: Clustering similar memories, building hierarchical memory structures
  - Knowledge Distillation: Transferring key patterns from external memory into parametric memory

        • SYNAPSE is a brain-inspired memory architecture that replaces static vector retrieval with a unified episodic–semantic graph, addressing the “context isolation” issue in traditional RAG systems, where semantically distant yet causally related memories cannot be effectively associated.<br>
        • It introduces cognitive dynamics such as spreading activation, lateral inhibition, and temporal decay to dynamically propagate relevance and filter noise within the graph, rather than relying solely on precomputed links or vector similarity.<br>
        • SYNAPSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LoCoMo benchmark, significantly improving multi-hop reasoning capabilities and robustness to adversarial queries through an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism.

        • Offline, an LLM performs OpenIE to extract triples and form a KG, and adds passages as nodes linked to phrase nodes to fuse concept-level structure with context-rich passages. Online, it first retrieves top-k triples with embeddings, then uses an LLM for triple filtering to remove irrelevant triples; the remaining nodes seed a PPR run to rank the most relevant passages for the generator.<br>
        • It evaluates factual QA, multi-hop reasoning, and narrative understanding, reporting Recall@5 for retrieval and F1 for QA. Compared with BM25, dense retrievers, and multiple structured-RAG baselines, HippoRAG 2 generally improves retrieval and end-to-end QA, and ablations plus “growing-corpus” settings support the contribution of its components.

        • During training, gold SPARQL queries are decomposed into query fragments, and a natural-language explanation is generated for each fragment to build a query memory bank of (explanation → fragment) pairs. At inference time, the LLM generates step-by-step plans; reconstruction uses semantic retrieval (Sentence-BERT) to fetch an adaptive Top-N set of fragments, then assembles them with rules and fills entity slots to produce the final executable query.<br>

          • <strong>Methodology:</strong> Utilizes a "Cognitive-Stream Reconstruction" pipeline to transform raw narratives into flashback-aware, time-anchored streams rich in inner thoughts and sensory details. It employs a 3-tier hierarchical evaluation suite ranging from factual extraction to psychoanalytic depth.<br>
          • <strong>Findings:</strong> Experiments with various memory architectures (RAG, Mem0, MemOS) reveal that while retrieval systems improve factual accuracy, they struggle with temporal grounding and deep reasoning (e.g., the "Update Paradox"), highlighting a critical gap in modeling the complex, non-linear nature of human memory.
